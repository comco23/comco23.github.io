- Tea times are weekly lab meetings happening on Monday at 16:00 & Thursday at 13:00. They run throughout the year, even in the break between terms. Only dates in summer, Christmas, and similar times where most people are on the road are skipped.
- **Participation is mandatory for all members of NBP.**
- The tea times are currently managed by Shadi Derakhshan, [sderakhshan@uni-osnabrueck.de](sderakhshan@uni-osnabrueck.de).
- Each tea time features one presentation.

  - Each one is obligated to present during his/her time here working at the NBP at least once (BSc), twice (MSc), or more often (PhD).
  - The topics may be the most interesting poster seen at a conference, the plan for a new project, preliminary results of a project, organization of labs, hygiene rules, ... whatever. 
  - In practice, most often colleagues present their current work to the lab for discussion and feedback. But this is not a must.
  - When choosing the topic for your presentation focus. Avoid reporting all you have done for ages. Think about the one question you want to have comments or feedback on. Then structure your tea time around that.
  - The presentation should target not more than 20', seriously. We discuss a lot. And nobody ever complained when tea time was finished early. In any case, we stop after 1h at the latest.

- These meetings take place either physically (Thursdays) or online (Mondays).
  - Online meetings are via Google Meeting (https://meet.google.com/okp-ggqc-zjb). Shadi sends around the link shortly before the meeting.
  - Physical meetings are in 50/E04.

- Preparing your presentation: [how to give good talks](slides/7-GivingGoodTalks.pdf). Do it this way. Go through the bullet list and adhere to all items.
  - Giving good presentations is an integral skill to building a successful scientific career; therefore the best place to practice is during these tea times.
  - You may discuss the slides with your colleagues and supervisor.
