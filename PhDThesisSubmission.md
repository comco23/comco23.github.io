If not, here is the English version. So you need:

* Application for [acceptance at the doctoral committee of the FB 08](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.psychologie-cms.uni-osnabrueck.de%2Ffileadmin%2Fdocuments%2Fpublic%2FAntrag_auf_Annahme_Psy.doc&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK)

* [Confirmation of Supervision Doctoral Study](https://www.psychologie-cms.uni-osnabrueck.de/fileadmin/documents/public/Betreuungszusage_Promotionen.pdf) must be submitted to the Registrar's Office for enrollment: Have confirmation signed by supervisor* and submit to the office of the doctoral committee of FB 08 to be signed by the chair of the doctoral committee.

Enrollment is required at the time of claiming university services (assessment, examination). Enrollments can be done only for semesters you hand in your dissertation and organize your disputation. However, I have always enrolled to get student discounts everywhere.

**Keep copies of all these documents in a folder. You will need them later on.**

* Some general notes:
Professor Heidemann will tell you to read the Promotionsordnung, which you can find [online](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/fileadmin/public/media/pdf/PromO-FB08-PhD_2011-09.pdf).
You should read it carefully, but it does not hold all the valuable information about the required documents.

Therefore, we made a checklist [PhDSubmissionChecklist](/slides/PhDSubmissionChecklist.pdf) for you. 

However, there are some other things you have to keep in mind:

- Start with the thesis early on, and best to do it in LaTeX or Overleaf from the
very beginning. At first, you need some time if you haven't worked with LaTeX, but a document with more than 100 pages save you a lot of time. Also, there are excellent tutorials on youtube.
- Do yourself a favor and use good literature managing software (i.e., Zotero). This will format your references for you.
- You are free to use any template for your dissertation, but there are sections that you need to have in the following order:
- Cover page ( optional, but who doesn’t like an excellent cover. remember to follow strict copyrights rules for it, though)
- Title page normally includes the name of the promotion committee members and the following statement in german. “Dissertation zur Erlangung des Grades Doktor der Naturwissenschaften (Dr. rer. nat.) im Fachbereich Humanwissenschaften der  Universität Osnabrück”, followed by “Osnabrück Year” at the end of the page and your name somewhere on the page.

- A dedication, if you want to dedicate your work to something or someone
- Acknowledgments ( here, you can thank everyone around you who helped you in your Ph.D.)
  - Abstract
  - Table of contents
  - List of Publications and Talks
  - Table of Figures
  - Table of tables
  - Thesis chapters (usually starting with a general introduction and ending with a general discussion). Note: if you are doing a cumulative thesis, whenever you use a paper as a chapter or part of the chapter, mention the complete author list as well as where and when it was published/submitted
  - Appendices if you have any
  - Disclaimer ( this is a very important page as it is here that you state all your studies are approved by the university's ethics committee and follow the [Helsinki convention](https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for-medical-research-involving-human-subjects/). Also, you have to state that you are the only person who wrote this thesis and that the thesis is your work and is not used for the purpose of grading anywhere else nor it is published before”
  - Bibliography

- To save time and your sanity: make a physical folder right away where you keep the IDP and the acceptance letter you received at the beginning of your Ph.D. studies - this will ease a lot of hassle at the end

- Don’t ask Heidemann. He won’t reply. Rather ask the [Promotionsausschuss08@uni-osnabrück](Promotionsausschuss08@uni-osnabrück)
- If you are going to print at Prindi ( print shop in Westerberg), go with A4 the template, as A5 won’t have a hardcover, and they don’t print regular book size (B5)
- Before handing in your thesis, ensure you have your supervisors' green light. They won’t read your entire dissertation before handing it in, but they can tell you if they feel it is ready for hand in

### When you are ready to hand in:

You can use the checklist to help you prepare the documents you need for submission. If you are fluent in German, you can also use the site from the department of psychology that you find here. You need at least 3 members for your promotion committee that will read and evaluate your shiny thesis. At least one member should be a professor from IKW, and one should be external and have no affiliation with the University of Osnabrück. Furthermore, they need to cover all the topics mentioned in your thesis. For example, if your thesis covers virtual reality, psychology, and neural networks, the members of your promotion committee should show expertise in these fields.

You also need a minimum of 3 members, at least one internal and one external, as before, for your disputation ( aka defense session, aka oral exam). These members
can be different or the same as the members of the previous committee.

### What happens after submission:

The promotion office’s central committee meets only once per month to approve submitted theses to enter the doctoral procedure ( Hauptverfahren der Promotion) so check the dates in advance with the promotion office. After approval, your nominated committee members have a maximum of 3 months to evaluate your written dissertation. Please note that if the grades from your dissertation differ more than 2 grades, your dissertation will be evaluated by two more external evaluators. This will prolong the entire process for 3 more months.  After your dissertation is graded, you have one month to make an appointment for your disputation session. This means that your whole doctoral procedure can take, in worst case, up to one year . At the end of your disputation, you will receive your final grade, consisting of 1/3 presentaion grade and 2/3 dissertation grade.

### Preparing for your disputation:
After the members of your promotion committee have assessed your dissertation and sent their evaluation to the promotion office, your disputation organization begins. The promotion office will not directly inform you that your dissertation evaluation is ready. You get usually informed you are ready to plan your defense via a public email currently sent by Beate Eibisch with the following title "Hochschulöffentliche Auslage der Dissertation und der Gutachten im Promotionsverfahren von". Once you see your name in the announcement, you can start planning your disputation. 

Note: there should be at least 3 weeks between the date your evaluation is announced and the date for your disputation since anyone interested should be able to read your dissertation and comment on it if they wish.

We suggest you begin planning by finding the members of your promotion committee for disputation. According to the current Promotionordnung of our faculty, your promotion committee should include the following member:
- One head of the committee ( Vorsitz ): They should be a habilitated member of our faculty ( AKA, professor ) who did not previously read or graded your thesis. The head of the committee is responsible for all the formalities during the disputation session and, even in an online disputation, should be present with you in the same room so make sure they can attend the meeting in person. 
- Two to four extra members from whom two should be the same members that graded your dissertation, and at least one of them is a member of our faculty.
- In general, three members and a head of committee is the best option here, since it allows for one person to drop out of the disputation. Two members is the minimum, but if one member is absent e.g. due to sickness, the disputation is cancelled. 

Therefore you can organize your disputation with a minimum of 3 and at most 5 committee members. Once you have invited all the members, you can begin finding a date. Here there is no best strategy, but we suggest you start by eliminating the dates that do not work for the head of the committee and then other committee members. (Ask everyone for a month and then create a really long doodle) Once you have the date, time, and room planned for your disputation session, you can inform the option office via email with the name of the members as well as the room number. Date and time for your disputation. It is worth noting that with the corona regulations being relieved, you need a different form for an online disputation where you should inform the promotion office with a valid reason that you can not hold your disputation online. In opioid, any extra stress, please keep the internal deadlines of the promotion office in mind. Disputations like a hand-in of your dissertation should be approved and signed by Dr. Heidemann.

After all the formalities are done and approved, you will receive the signed invitation for your disputation session via email and post a copy of your thesis evaluations. Remember, you can always request to receive the evaluations earlier. Afterward, you need to prepare your presentation! Good luck with your disputation, and try to relax! 

## The day of your disputation:

Remember all the organization of the session is on you. Therefore you need to make sure everything works as well as possible. Once the disputation begins, you have at most 30 minutes to present your work. Remember, it is terrible if you present for 31 minutes it is perfectly fine if you finish in 27 minutes, so plan your time well. Once you are finished with your presentation, the questions begin. First, the committee member will ask questions, and afterward, the head of the committee will open the questioning for the public. This part typically takes half an hour. However, there are no set rules, which might go a bit longer. 

Following the questions, the committee will ask everyone to leave the room while they discuss your grade. Your final grade will be the arithmetic weighted mean of your dissertation grades and your disputation grades, where a dissertation grade is worth twice the one in disputation. The committee then calls you to give you feedback on your disputation and announce your final grade. 

The final grade will not be announced to the public, but you are free to do so if you wish. The committee will congratulate you as a doctor however will inform you that you may not use the title until you publish your dissertation. This is the moment you can finally party a bit before proceeding with the final steps. 

Here is the list of possible grades for your Ph.D.: 

[0.0 - 0.5) : Summa cum laude ( outstanding )
[0.5 - 1.5) : Magna cum laude ( very good )
[1.5 - 2.5) : Cum laude ( good )
[2.5 - 3.5) : Rite ( satisfactory / pass )

## What happens after disputation:
To finally receive your doctorate title and your degree after your disputation, you have to submit 6 copies of your thesis to the library of the University of Osnabrück as well as one of the following options:
- Submitting 80 more copies to the university library.
- Submitting an electronic version of the thesis to the university library
- Publishing your thesis in a scientific journal

You have 12 months to finalize this procedure and receive your degree!

## Publishing your dissertation as e-publication in the university library:

There is a comprehensive guide in [English](https://www.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de/forschen_publizieren/dissertationen/handout_for_e_dissertations.html) and [German](https://www.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de/forschen_publizieren/dissertationen/handreichung_e_dissertation.html) that you can follow to publish your dissertation.  The person to go if you have questions on this matter is Dr. Hindersmann at the uni library. However, the short list of what you need to do is as follows: 

- Print 6 extra copies of your dissertation. 
- Prepare your pdf version to upload to the [osnaDocs website](https://osnadocs.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de/ldap-login) of the library. Next to your pdf version, the source file (word, latex, etc.) must be uploaded in zip format next to your pdf version. 
- your files should use the names thesis_lastname.pdf and thesis_lastname.zip.
- your pdf file should comply with PDF-A ( PDF/A-2b, PDF/A-1b, or preferably PDF/A-2a ) standards which are suitable for long-term archiving. There is an [official guide here](https://www.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de/forschen_publizieren/e_publikationen_der_uos_osnadocs/anleitung_pdfa.html) on how to confirm this standard in LibreOffice, Word, and Latex however, it is only available in german. Alternatively, you can also use adobe acrobat X pro, Print Production panel -> Preflight -> standards to validate your pdf's conformance with PDF-A standard or convert your document to the standard.

Note: if your dissertation is cumulative, you must ensure you own the copyright or follow the correct copyright for papers used in your dissertation. Otherwise, you need to take the papers out and refer them using their link. 

- Print, fill out and sign two copies of the [contract](https://www.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de/fileadmin/documents/public/Startseite/4_Publizieren_und_Archivieren/4_3_E-Dissertationen/4_3_1_Leitfaden_E-Dissertationen/vertrag.pdf) with the library.
- Print, fill out and sign one copy of the declaration [Eidesstattliche Versicherung](https://www.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de/fileadmin/documents/public/Startseite/4_Publizieren_und_Archivieren/4_3_E-Dissertationen/4_3_1_Leitfaden_E-Dissertationen/eidesstatt.pdf).
- Hand in the six dissertation copies along the above forms to Dr. Hinndersmann in person or by post. 
- Inform the promotion office that you have published your dissertation to the library by providing the overview document you can print while uploading your dissertation. 

once all these steps are done, the promotion office will inform the library that all examination matters for your Ph.D. is done.  After the library receives this information from the promotion office, they will unlock and publish your thesis. Finally, you will be informed by email once your dissertation is published. You can now use your Dr grade and go to the promotion office to receive your official degree! That's all!


Keep Calm and
