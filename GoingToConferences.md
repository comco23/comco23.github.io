## Going to Conferences

- General
  - As a Ph.D. student, you should go to conferences.
  - Encourage BSc/MSc students you supervise to attend conferences.
  - No poster, no conference. There is no tourism to conferences.
  - Do NOT team up with other lab members to go to the same conference.
  - The distance/costs should be in good relation to the maturity and scope of the project.

- Flow of preparation
  - Have something to present.
  - Select a suitable conference and check relevant dates. 
  - Write an abstract and discuss with Peter
  - If ok, register at the conference and submit the abstract.

- Fill out, get signature and submit [Dienstreiseantrag](https://www.uni-osnabrueck.de/intranet/verwaltung/dezernat-3-finanzen/downloads/zentrale-angelegenheiten/#c11420) well ahead of time
- Make suitable travel and accommodation arrangements. Be aware of restrictions of reimbursement.
- When coming back, present something you learned at the conference in the tea-time.
