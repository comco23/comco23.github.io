					<p>
					Dora Angelaki is a Professor at the Center for Neural Science and the Tandon
					school of Engineering at New York University. She holds a diploma and Ph.D.
					degrees in electrical and biomedical engineering from the National Technical University
					of Athens, Greece, and the University of Minnesota. Interested in understanding the
					principles that make our brain so much better than man-made machines and AI,
					she uses naturalistic foraging tasks that combine uncertainty, spatial navigation,
					decision-making and episodic memory to understand inference in the brain. She explores
					how task-relevant latent variables and multisensory signals flow dynamically across
					brain areas to generate perception and cognition, how hierarchical causal inference
					is implemented in the brain, how beliefs propagate through the network, and how internal
					states modulate this information flow. </p>

					<p> Valerio Mante is a group leader at the Institute of Neuroinformatics. Dr. Mante obtained a master's degree in
						physics and a Ph.D. in neuroscience from ETH Zurich. Subsequently, he was a postdoctoral fellow at
						Stanford University and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. His laboratory uses a combination of
						experimental and computational approaches to investigate the role of prefrontal cortex in normal and
						impaired cognition (e.g. decision-making and attention). </p>

					<p> Froese is a German cognitive scientist with a background in computer science and complex systems.
						He is based in Japan at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University,
						where he heads the Embodied Cognitive Science Unit. The Unit investigates the interactive basis
						of life and mind with a variety of methods, including evolutionary robotics, agent-based modeling,
						sensory substitution interfaces, artificial neural networks, and virtual reality. Froese is 
						particularly known for his contributions to the field of artificial life and to the enactive approach
						to cognitive science. Currently he is coordinating the creation of an EEG hyperscanning lab and 
						developing a novel approach to quantifying the efficacy of agency called irruption theory. </p>
