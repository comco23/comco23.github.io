					Dora Angelaki is a Professor at the Center for Neural Science and the Tandon
					school of Engineering at New York University. She holds a diploma and Ph.D.
					degrees in electrical and biomedical engineering from the National Technical University
					of Athens, Greece, and the University of Minnesota. Interested in understanding the
					principles that make our brain so much better than man-made machines and AI,
					she uses naturalistic foraging tasks that combine uncertainty, spatial navigation,
					decision-making and episodic memory to understand inference in the brain. She explores
					how task-relevant latent variables and multisensory signals flow dynamically across
					brain areas to generate perception and cognition, how hierarchical causal inference
					is implemented in the brain, how beliefs propagate through the network, and how internal
					states modulate this information flow. </p>

					<p> Valerio Mante is a group leader at the Institute of Neuroinformatics. Dr. Mante
						holds a master’s degree in physics and a Ph.D. in neuroscience from ETH Zurich.
						For his Ph.D. thesis, he worked in the laboratory of Professor Matteo Carandini,
						studying the computational principles of early visual processing in mammals.
						Subsequently, he was a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Professor Bill Newsome
						at Stanford University, California. In Stanford, he studied the neural processes underlying
						context-dependent behavior, and discovered a new mechanism that allows neural signals to be
						flexibly gated between different brain areas. Since 2013, he is back in Zurich, where his
						laboratory focuses on understanding the role of prefrontal cortex in normal and impaired cognition.</p>
