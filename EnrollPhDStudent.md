## How to Enroll as PhD student

There are two parts to this process:
1) Application for acceptance as a PhD student
This is obligatory if you wish your work to culminate in a PhD degree

2) Enrollment as a student in the respective semester

This is optional but highly recommended. For example, having student status allows you to check out books at the library, eat at the Mensa for a cheaper price, etc.

You will need the #1 in order to obtain #2. 

For an application for acceptance as a PhD student, you will need to submit the following documents to the PhD Admission Board:

* High school certificate/transcript
* Bachelor certificate
* Master certificate
* CV
* Form "Confirmation of conclusion of an Individual Development Plan (IDP) for PhD studies
* Form "Erklärung über etwaige frühere Promotionsgesuche"
* Form "Antrag auf Annahme als Doktorandin oder Doktorand"
* Form "Betreuungszusage Promotionen"
* One page exposé/abstract of your planned thesis
*Original or certified copy required

Note: Please submit the forms in German. Only the confirmation of the IDP and IDP itself may be in English.

If you need the documents or have further questions about how to submit them, please contact Ms. Johanna Kalkenings from the Doctoral Committee [promotionsausschussfb08@uni-osnabrueck.de](promotionsausschussfb08@uni-osnabrueck.de)

For enrolling in the current school semester (winter or summer), you will need the following documents:

Confirmation that you have health insurance in Germany or that you are exempt from being insured here (at least if you are younger than 30 – but please ask her personally)
