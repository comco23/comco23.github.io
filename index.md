## onboarding

If you are completely new to nbp and/or the University Osnabrück:

Please go through the [starting at nbp page](/StartingAtNBP), there you will find basic information about starting work at the nbp. Note the two documents that need to be filled out and returned to the secretary: the “Check in form”, and the “Application for Obtaining a Key/Transponder” (“Antrag Schluessel-Transponderausgabe”).

You will also find a few more documents on general aspects of life at the NBP such as Safety Guidelines, tips on how to write your thesis and general forms that you might need during your stay here. Have a look at these documents. They might really help you.
