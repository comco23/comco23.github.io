## lab book

every new student writing his/her thesis with us gets a so-called lab book (for free), highly recommended by Peter König for documenting your experiments, data collecting and analysing. Feel free to pick up yours at the nbp office and also get a free USB stick for that day in the future, when you will be handing in your thesis plus data.

## lab rotation

please enroll yourself in the lab rotation course 8.3017 on StudIP and check out our official [website](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/research_groups/neurobiopsychology/teaching/lab_rotation.html) for more information.

## onboarding of new nbp members

if you want to write your bachelor, master or doctorate thesis under Peter König's supervision or co-supervision, please contact him first. The onboarding steps (getting you on our mailing list, StudIP "nbp internal", website etc.) come next, and Julia Reuter will be your contact then.

## business trips (applications and reimbursement)

if you want to go on a business trip, you need to get Peter König's ok first. After that, there are lots of bureaucratic steps to do: Most important is to submit your application form early on! You will find all the relevant documents in the UOS intranet, accessible with your 
LDAP Account: [D.3/Downloads/Reisekosten](D.3/Downloads/Reisekosten)
Peter König: [pkoenig@uos.de](pkoenig@uos.de)

**ATTENTION!** It's often forgotten that you can get the money for the travel BEFORE booking. This eases your life a lot!

Please fill out the "Antrag Abschlagszahlung für Reisekosten (Vorschuss)" in the [D.3/Downloads/Reisekosten](D.3/Downloads/Reisekosten) and hand it in together with the initial travel application.

To apply for the payment upfront, your estimated costs have to exceed 200€.  So what should you do?

1. You fill in the application for the travel
2. You calculate the estimated costs for the entire travel (train, car, taxi, conference fees, hotels...etc.) and fill it in the "Vorschuss". This can easily add up to more than 1000€. Look up the cost on the internet, but do not book yet.
3. You hand in both sheets to Peter to sign - and then get processed by Beate. These payments often go pretty fast. Usually 10 days maximum.
4. With the money in your bank account you book your entire travel and keep the receipts
5. After your travel, you fill in the reimbursement form, which you will find below. Here you insert all receipts and payments, as well as the upfront payments.

HiWis: If you want to become a HiWi in the nbp or would like to continue your contract, Peter König is your first contact. The mandatory timesheet has to be submitted (signed hard copy) at the end of each working month.

## Reimbursement of expenses (specifically for experiments)
Please, fill in the new attached form and then submit it (as a signed hard copy) to Peter König for his signature. After that, please, hand the form over to Julia Reuter.

For the reimbursement of "Versuchspersonengelder", there is also an additional new document which needs to be filled out and handed to Julia Reuter. (also as a hard copy)
Peter König: [pkoenig@uos.de](pkoenig@uos.de)


## General reimbursements

Please submit the original invoice along with a proof of payment to Julia. You can place these documents in the NBP office folder located in the printing room. Julia will also require your bank details and address for reimbursement processing. If you have any additional questions regarding reimbursements, please feel free to reach out to her.

## Transponders

The application form for a transponder can be downloaded here. Please, submit it as a duly signed hard copy to Peter König. After that, please, hand the form over to Julia Reuter.

## Days off / Holidays / Vacation
Not everybody knows that if you work for the university, you have an orange vacation card. If you do not have your orange card yet, you can contact Dr. Tobias Thelen [office-ikw@uni-osnabrueck.de](office-ikw@uni-osnabrueck.de) so he can hand it out to you.

On the vacation card, you need to fill out the dates (Urlaub von bis) you want to take and then you need to sign it. (Unterschrift)

After you have done that, please give the card to Peter König, so , as the head of the lab, he can sign it.

Once it has been signed by you and by Peter, I (Julia Reuter) will return the card to Dr. Thelen so he can officially grant the days off. You will then be handed back the card with Dr. Thelen’s signature.

Don’t worry. It might sound complicated, but it really isn’t. :)

## NBP science chat

There is a Telegram group which is intended to be a communication channel for everything science related, for example share interesting ressources, papers or tutorials, communicate about different methods, share knowledge about methods and applications (e.g. on eye tracking, EEG, VR, modeling, PCA). This will allow also to just search the chat for keywords.

## IKW goes Mensa
there is also the *IKW goes to Mensa* telegram group, that serves as a communication channel across research groups for all IKW members to discuss meeting up to go to Mensa/Lunch together. Typically, a group (mostly consisting out of NBP members) meets up for lunch on Tuesdays, starting to walk at 12:45h from the Institute and 13h at Mensa.
