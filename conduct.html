                    <p> We care about you and want you to feel comfortable during the ComCo 2023 conference! </p>
                    <p> The ComCo 2023 conference is dedicated to providing a space for scientific exchange, presentations of
                              ongoing research, discussions of ideas, and overall, to offer a welcoming and inspirational
                              environment for the computational and cognitive science community. To allow everyone to focus
                              on science and exchange, it is crucial to ensure a harassment-free conference experience for
                              everyone and provide an inclusive environment to the benefit of all.
                    </p>
                    We all share the responsibility to work on a welcoming and respectful environment for every participant
                    attending the ComCo 2023. Therefore, we ask you to agree to the code of conduct during registration of the
                    conference and will also put an awareness team in place during the conference.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Awareness team</h3>
                    During the conference, an awareness team will be in place. The awareness team will consist of people with different gender identities and will be the first contact point for all attending parties. Feel free to approach the awareness team at any time you experience or witness any violations of the code of conduct or other harmful behavior. This includes also any experiences on the way to or back from the conference (during the travel, hotel, transit). The awareness team will be available to support you, even if you already "handled" the situation or if you are not sure if it's "bad” enough” to involve the awareness team. They will help you figure out what you want and need. The awareness team is put in place to ensure a low level contact point and to provide support, whether it is just to listen to the experience or to prepare further steps or actions.
