                <h2>ComCo 2023: Code of Conduct and the Care Team</h2> </br>
                <h5>We care about you and want you to feel comfortable during the ComCo 2023 conference!</h5> </br>
                <p> The ComCo 2023 conference is dedicated to providing a space for scientific exchange, presentations of ongoing
                    research, discussions of ideas, and overall, to offer an welcoming and inspirational environment for the
                    computational and cognitive science community. To allow everyone to focus on science and exchange, it is crucial
                    to ensure a harassment-free conference experience for everyone and provide an inclusive environment to the 
                    benefit of all.</p>
                
                <p>We all share the responsibility to work on a welcoming and respectful environment for every participant attending the ComCo 2023.
                    Therefore, we ask you to agree to the code of conduct during registration of the conference and will also put an awareness team
                    in place during the conference.</p>

                <h3>Awareness Team</h3></br>

                <p>During the conference, an awareness team will be in place. The Awareness team will consist of people with different
                    gender identities and will be the first contact point for all attending parties. Feel free to approach the Awareness
                    team at any time you experience or witness any violations of the code of conduct or other harmful behavior. This includes
                    also any experiences on the way to or back from the conference (during the travel, hotel, transit). The Awareness team will
                    be available to support you, even if you already "handled" the situation or if you are not sure if it's "bad enough” to
                    involve the Awareness team. They will help you figure out what you want and need. The Awareness team is put in place to
                    ensure a low level contact point and to provide support, whether it is just to listen to the experience or to prepare further
                    steps or actions.</p>
                    
                <h3>Code of Conduct</h3></br>

                <h5>Harassment of any forms is strictly prohibited during the conference.
                    Specific prohibited behaviors include but are not limited to the following:</h5></br>

                <p>&#8226; Harassment, intimidation, unwelcome behavior or unwelcome comments based on sexual orientation, gender identity,
                    gender expression, age, disability, appearance, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or other group status</p>
                <p>&#8226; Advocating for other dehumanizing viewpoints</p>
                <p>&#8226; Sexual harassment or intimidation, including unwelcome sexual attention or sexual “jokes”</p>
                <p>&#8226; Unsolicited photography or recording</p>
                <p>&#8226; Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior</p>

                <p>In addition, we ask you to:</p>
                <p>&#8226; Respect the preferred pronouns of all participants</p>
                <p>&#8226; To make every effort to frame discussions as openly and inclusively as possible</p>
                <p>&#8226; Overall commit to a respectful way of interacting with each other</p>
                    
                <p>Please note, that this code of conduct is not intended to limit the terms of open and respectful scientific inquiry or discussion.
                    Critical examination, debate, and robust disagreement regarding beliefs and viewpoints, relevant to the topic of discussion and
                    presented respectfully do not, in themselves, constitute harassment. Similarly, imagery, language, or sound that is relevant to
                    the topic of discussion and presented respectfully does not in itself constitute harassment.</p>

                <p>We expect all participants to follow this code of conduct at all conference related activities. Please remember that any kind of harassment will not be tolerated! </p>

                <h5>Inappropriate behaviors and/or violations of this, whether formally listed here or not, can lead to exclusion from the event without a refund!</h5></br>

                <p>If anything happens to you or if you observe any participants or behaviors that are concerning to you and/or are in violation of the code of conduct,
                    please immediately contact the awareness team.</p>
                <p>We acknowledge that different people may hold more or less power in a community, however, everyone will be held to the same standards of behavior and
                    misconduct will be addressed regardless of the status or identity of the perpetrator.</p>
                <p>Thank you for helping us work towards a safe and inclusive space for the ComCo 2023 conference. We are very much looking forward to welcoming you to
                    the University of Osnabrück!</p>
